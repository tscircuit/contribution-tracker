| [#662](https://github.com/tscircuit/3d-viewer/pull/662) | 🐙 Minor | ⭐⭐ | Fixes incorrect orientation of bottom-layer CAD components by correcting Z-axis rotation handling during layer flipping. |
| [#660](https://github.com/tscircuit/3d-viewer/pull/660) | 🐙 Minor | ⭐⭐ | Fixes a rendering bug in the JSCAD viewer by standardizing the default PCB thickness from 1.6 mm to 1.4 mm, ensuring consistent soldermask visualization across panelized boards. |
| [#655](https://github.com/tscircuit/3d-viewer/pull/655) | 🐙 Minor | ⭐⭐ | Fixes soldermask clearance issues for polygon-shaped pads by rendering their full outlines, ensuring accurate fabrication and visual fidelity. |
| [#123](https://github.com/tscircuit/circuit-to-canvas/pull/123) | 🐙 Minor | ⭐⭐ | Fixes incorrect silkscreen text placement by properly handling all center-based anchor alignments and locking the behavior down with a comprehensive visual regression test. |
| [#121](https://github.com/tscircuit/circuit-to-canvas/pull/121) | 🐙 Minor | ⭐⭐ | This PR introduces an explicit rendering switch to separate PCB outline drawing from substrate (front material) fill, eliminating unintended visual occlusion and improving layer correctness across canvas renders. |

| [#86](https://github.com/tscircuit/circuit-json-to-lbrn/pull/86) | 🐙 Minor | ⭐⭐ | Summary Fixed critical bug where traces failed to merge with connected rectangular plated hole pads, causing separate shapes instead of continuous copper. Implemented by refactoring copper geometry handling to eliminate code duplication and ensure consistent net-connection behavior.  Changes New helper function: addCopperGeometryToNetOrProject() centralizes net-connected vs. unconnected copper geometry logic Refactored 10 handlers: All plated hole (4) and SMT pad (6) handlers now use standardized merging logic Bug resolution: Plated hole pads correctly merge with traces on same net instead of creating gapsoverlaps Test coverage: Added example04 test case demonstrating proper trace-pad continuity |
| [#30](https://github.com/tscircuit/pcbburn.com/pull/30) | 🐙 Minor | ⭐⭐ | Fixes disruptive viewport resets in the SVG preview when interacting with the PCB burn settings panel, preserving user zoom and pan states during configuration changes. |
