    "title": "Matching and scoring system, better grid stringification",
    "description": "This pull request introduces a matching and scoring system for netlists, enhancing the ability to compare different netlist pairings based on their similarity. It also improves the grid stringification process for better visualization of circuit layouts. Key changes include the addition of new functions for computing similarity distances, identifying issues in matched boxes, and generating auto labels for chips. The changes aim to facilitate the building of keyboards by providing better tools for netlist management and visualization.",

    "description": "This pull request introduces complex layouts based on tscircuit, implements normalization fixes, and adds functionality to apply and retrieve net lists from Circuit JSON. It includes significant changes to the ChipBuilder and CircuitBuilder classes, enhancing their capabilities to handle layouts and net lists more effectively. The changes also involve the addition of new files for converting Circuit JSON to input netlists and applying layouts to Circuit JSON, which are essential for improving the overall functionality of the tscircuit library.",
