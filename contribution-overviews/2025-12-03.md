## Scoring & Sponsorship System

### Overview

PRs are analyzed by AI and assigned a **star rating (1-3 stars)**. 4 and 5 star ratings can only be manually assigned by staff. Weekly scores use `2^(starRating - 1)` per PR (capped at 12 PRs per rating), plus review/discussion points.

### Weekly Score → Star String

| Score Range | Star String | Count Value |
|------------|-------------|-------------|
| 0-3 | (empty) | 0 stars |
| 4-10 | ⭐ | 1 star |
| 11-30 | ⭐⭐ | 2 stars |
| 31-50 | ⭐⭐⭐ | 3 stars |
| 51-75 | 👑 | 1 crown |
| 76-100 | 👑👑 | 2 crowns |
| 101+ | 👑👑👑 | 3 crowns |

> Crowns count as 3 stars for sponsorship.

### Monthly Sponsorship Calculation

The sponsorship system calculates monthly payments based on your **weekly star counts** over the complete weeks in that month (typically 4-5 weeks, Wednesday-Tuesday format).

**Step 1: Collect Weekly Stars**
- All complete weeks in the month are analyzed
- Each week's star string is converted to a numeric count (⭐ = 1 star, ⭐⭐⭐ = 3 stars)
- Example: `[2, 2, 2, 1, 0]` means 2 stars in week 1, 2 stars in week 2, etc.

**Step 2: Calculate Metrics**
- **Median stars**: The median value of all weekly star counts
- **Min stars**: The minimum weekly star count
- **Max stars**: The maximum weekly star count
- **High score**: The maximum raw weekly score (0-100+ range from the scoring table) from any week in the month

**Step 3: Determine Base Amount**
The sponsorship amount is calculated based on these metrics (checked in order):

| Condition | Base Amount |
|-----------|-------------|
| `minStarCount >= 3` | **$500** |
| `medianStars >= 3` | **$450** |
| `medianStars >= 2.5` | **$300** |
| `medianStars >= 2` | **$200** |
| `medianStars >= 1.5` | **$100** |
| `medianStars >= 1` | **$75** |
| `maxStarCount >= 2` | **$25** |
| `maxStarCount >= 1` | **$15** |
| `highScore >= 3` (and all stars = 0) | **$5** |

| Maintainer Level | Monthly Bonus |
|------------------|---------------|
| Level 1 | **$200** |
| Level 2 | **$350** |
| Level 3 | **$500** |

**Final Amount** = Base Amount + Maintainer Bonus

### [tscircuit/circuit-json-to-lbrn](https://github.com/tscircuit/circuit-json-to-lbrn)

| PR # | Impact | Rating | Contributor | Description |
|------|--------|--------|-------------|-------------|
| [#48](https://github.com/tscircuit/circuit-json-to-lbrn/pull/48) | 🐳 Major | ⭐⭐⭐⭐ | AnasSarkiz | Summary This PR introduces a full multi-layer copper architecture featuring independent top and bottom copper processing, precise via-aware trace splitting, and flexible layer-selective export. These improvements elevate the converter to true multi-layer PCB capability and enable advanced manufacturing workflows such as selective laser cutting, single-side operations, and accurate double-sided production. Key Enhancements 1. Dedicated TopBottom Copper Layers Replaces the previous single copper pipeline Each layer receives its own geometry and cut settings Supports double-sided PCB workflows with proper layer isolation 2. Via-Aware Multi-Layer Trace Splitting Correctly segments traces at vias Distributes trace geometry to the appropriate copper layer Ensures accurate copper distribution across stackups 3. New includeLayers Option (with full examples) The converter now allows exporting any combination of copper layers: tsx  Process all layers (default) convertCircuitJsonToLbrn(circuitJson)  Process only top layer convertCircuitJsonToLbrn(circuitJson,  includeLayers: top )  Process only bottom layer convertCircuitJsonToLbrn(circuitJson,  includeLayers: bottom )  Process both layers explicitly (bottom, top is equivalent to default) convertCircuitJsonToLbrn(circuitJson,  includeLayers: bottom, top )  Supports single-sided manufacturing Allows explicit multi-layer selection Maintains full backward compatibility 4. Updated Element Handling SMT Pads: Routed based on layer property Traces: Grouped and processed by copper layer Vias  Plated Holes: Added to both copper layers  through-board layer Reflects real-world multi-layer PCB behavior Cut Settings Update Previous: Copper Through Board Soldermask New: Top Copper (index 0) Bottom Copper (index 1) Through Board (index 2) Soldermask (index 3) This provides granular control but introduces index changes. Motivation The previous single-layer approach prevented accurate multi-layer export, limiting: Side-specific laser settings Selective production of top or bottom side Correct representation of traces that change layers via vias This PR removes these limitations and establishes a robust, production-ready multi-layer pipeline. Testing  Validation  All 39 existing tests pass  Comprehensive multi-layer tests added (using keyboard-default60.json)  Verified trace splitting at vias  Verified per-layer filtering and geometry isolation Tested on a 183-trace multi-layer board: All layers  Top: 402, Bottom: 512, Through: 455 Top only  402  through-board Bottom only  512  through-board Both explicitly  Same as all layers Breaking Changes  Cut setting indices updated: Soldermask: 2  3 Through Board: 1  2 Projects that reference indices numerically may require updates. Conclusion This PR delivers a complete, robust multi-layer copper system, enabling precise topbottom separation, accurate via segmentation, and flexible layer inclusion for manufacturing workflows. It significantly improves correctness, configurability, and production readiness. |

| [#48](https://github.com/tscircuit/circuit-json-to-lbrn/pull/48) | 🐳 Major | ⭐⭐⭐⭐ | Summary This PR introduces a full multi-layer copper architecture featuring independent top and bottom copper processing, precise via-aware trace splitting, and flexible layer-selective export. These improvements elevate the converter to true multi-layer PCB capability and enable advanced manufacturing workflows such as selective laser cutting, single-side operations, and accurate double-sided production. Key Enhancements 1. Dedicated TopBottom Copper Layers Replaces the previous single copper pipeline Each layer receives its own geometry and cut settings Supports double-sided PCB workflows with proper layer isolation 2. Via-Aware Multi-Layer Trace Splitting Correctly segments traces at vias Distributes trace geometry to the appropriate copper layer Ensures accurate copper distribution across stackups 3. New includeLayers Option (with full examples) The converter now allows exporting any combination of copper layers: tsx  Process all layers (default) convertCircuitJsonToLbrn(circuitJson)  Process only top layer convertCircuitJsonToLbrn(circuitJson,  includeLayers: top )  Process only bottom layer convertCircuitJsonToLbrn(circuitJson,  includeLayers: bottom )  Process both layers explicitly (bottom, top is equivalent to default) convertCircuitJsonToLbrn(circuitJson,  includeLayers: bottom, top )  Supports single-sided manufacturing Allows explicit multi-layer selection Maintains full backward compatibility 4. Updated Element Handling SMT Pads: Routed based on layer property Traces: Grouped and processed by copper layer Vias  Plated Holes: Added to both copper layers  through-board layer Reflects real-world multi-layer PCB behavior Cut Settings Update Previous: Copper Through Board Soldermask New: Top Copper (index 0) Bottom Copper (index 1) Through Board (index 2) Soldermask (index 3) This provides granular control but introduces index changes. Motivation The previous single-layer approach prevented accurate multi-layer export, limiting: Side-specific laser settings Selective production of top or bottom side Correct representation of traces that change layers via vias This PR removes these limitations and establishes a robust, production-ready multi-layer pipeline. Testing  Validation  All 39 existing tests pass  Comprehensive multi-layer tests added (using keyboard-default60.json)  Verified trace splitting at vias  Verified per-layer filtering and geometry isolation Tested on a 183-trace multi-layer board: All layers  Top: 402, Bottom: 512, Through: 455 Top only  402  through-board Bottom only  512  through-board Both explicitly  Same as all layers Breaking Changes  Cut setting indices updated: Soldermask: 2  3 Through Board: 1  2 Projects that reference indices numerically may require updates. Conclusion This PR delivers a complete, robust multi-layer copper system, enabling precise topbottom separation, accurate via segmentation, and flexible layer inclusion for manufacturing workflows. It significantly improves correctness, configurability, and production readiness. |
