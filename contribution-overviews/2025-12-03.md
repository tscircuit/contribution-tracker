## Scoring & Sponsorship System

### Overview

PRs are analyzed by AI and assigned a **star rating (1-3 stars)**. 4 and 5 star ratings can only be manually assigned by staff. Weekly scores use `2^(starRating - 1)` per PR (capped at 12 PRs per rating), plus review/discussion points.

### Weekly Score → Star String

| Score Range | Star String | Count Value |
|------------|-------------|-------------|
| 0-3 | (empty) | 0 stars |
| 4-10 | ⭐ | 1 star |
| 11-30 | ⭐⭐ | 2 stars |
| 31-50 | ⭐⭐⭐ | 3 stars |
| 51-75 | 👑 | 1 crown |
| 76-100 | 👑👑 | 2 crowns |
| 101+ | 👑👑👑 | 3 crowns |

> Crowns count as 3 stars for sponsorship.

### Monthly Sponsorship Calculation

The sponsorship system calculates monthly payments based on your **weekly star counts** over the complete weeks in that month (typically 4-5 weeks, Wednesday-Tuesday format).

**Step 1: Collect Weekly Stars**
- All complete weeks in the month are analyzed
- Each week's star string is converted to a numeric count (⭐ = 1 star, ⭐⭐⭐ = 3 stars)
- Example: `[2, 2, 2, 1, 0]` means 2 stars in week 1, 2 stars in week 2, etc.

**Step 2: Calculate Metrics**
- **Median stars**: The median value of all weekly star counts
- **Min stars**: The minimum weekly star count
- **Max stars**: The maximum weekly star count
- **High score**: The maximum raw weekly score (0-100+ range from the scoring table) from any week in the month

**Step 3: Determine Base Amount**
The sponsorship amount is calculated based on these metrics (checked in order):

| Condition | Base Amount |
|-----------|-------------|
| `minStarCount >= 3` | **$700** |
| `medianStars >= 3` | **$550** |
| `medianStars >= 2.5` | **$400** |
| `medianStars >= 2` | **$250** |
| `medianStars >= 1.5` | **$120** |
| `medianStars >= 1` | **$75** |
| `maxStarCount >= 2` | **$45** |
| `maxStarCount >= 1` | **$30** |
| `highScore >= 3` (and all stars = 0) | **$10** |

| Maintainer Level | Monthly Bonus |
|------------------|---------------|
| Level 1 | **$200** |
| Level 2 | **$350** |
| Level 3 | **$500** |
| Level 4 | **$850** |
| Level 5 | **$1300** |
| Level 6 | **$2000** |

**Final Amount** = Base Amount + Maintainer Bonus

### [tscircuit/circuit-json-to-lbrn](https://github.com/tscircuit/circuit-json-to-lbrn)

| PR # | Impact | Rating | Contributor | Description |
|------|--------|--------|-------------|-------------|
| [#48](https://github.com/tscircuit/circuit-json-to-lbrn/pull/48) | 🐳 Major | ⭐⭐⭐⭐ | AnasSarkiz | Summary This PR introduces a full multi-layer copper architecture featuring independent top and bottom copper processing, precise via-aware trace splitting, and flexible layer-selective export. These improvements elevate the converter to true multi-layer PCB capability and enable advanced manufacturing workflows such as selective laser cutting, single-side operations, and accurate double-sided production. Key Enhancements 1. Dedicated TopBottom Copper Layers Replaces the previous single copper pipeline Each layer receives its own geometry and cut settings Supports double-sided PCB workflows with proper layer isolation 2. Via-Aware Multi-Layer Trace Splitting Correctly segments traces at vias Distributes trace geometry to the appropriate copper layer Ensures accurate copper distribution across stackups 3. New includeLayers Option (with full examples) The converter now allows exporting any combination of copper layers: tsx  Process all layers (default) convertCircuitJsonToLbrn(circuitJson)  Process only top layer convertCircuitJsonToLbrn(circuitJson,  includeLayers: top )  Process only bottom layer convertCircuitJsonToLbrn(circuitJson,  includeLayers: bottom )  Process both layers explicitly (bottom, top is equivalent to default) convertCircuitJsonToLbrn(circuitJson,  includeLayers: bottom, top )  Supports single-sided manufacturing Allows explicit multi-layer selection Maintains full backward compatibility 4. Updated Element Handling SMT Pads: Routed based on layer property Traces: Grouped and processed by copper layer Vias  Plated Holes: Added to both copper layers  through-board layer Reflects real-world multi-layer PCB behavior Cut Settings Update Previous: Copper Through Board Soldermask New: Top Copper (index 0) Bottom Copper (index 1) Through Board (index 2) Soldermask (index 3) This provides granular control but introduces index changes. Motivation The previous single-layer approach prevented accurate multi-layer export, limiting: Side-specific laser settings Selective production of top or bottom side Correct representation of traces that change layers via vias This PR removes these limitations and establishes a robust, production-ready multi-layer pipeline. Testing  Validation  All 39 existing tests pass  Comprehensive multi-layer tests added (using keyboard-default60.json)  Verified trace splitting at vias  Verified per-layer filtering and geometry isolation Tested on a 183-trace multi-layer board: All layers  Top: 402, Bottom: 512, Through: 455 Top only  402  through-board Bottom only  512  through-board Both explicitly  Same as all layers Breaking Changes  Cut setting indices updated: Soldermask: 2  3 Through Board: 1  2 Projects that reference indices numerically may require updates. Conclusion This PR delivers a complete, robust multi-layer copper system, enabling precise topbottom separation, accurate via segmentation, and flexible layer inclusion for manufacturing workflows. It significantly improves correctness, configurability, and production readiness. |

It generates accurate clearance regions and fills them with 45 crosshatched raster patterns using LightBurns Scan modesignificantly improving copper removal quality and fabrication reliability for laser-ablated PCBs. ---  Changes   New Features Automatic trace-margin clearance generation Computes the clearance area between normal-width traces and expanded traces (width  2margin) to create accurate isolation donut geometries. Crosshatch rasterization for copper removal Uses LightBurns Scan mode with a 45 crosshatch pattern for efficient and consistent margin ablation. Per-layer margin cut settings Provides dedicated cut settings for top and bottom copper clearances (LightBurn layer indices 4  5). Configurable laser spot size Laser spot size (default 0.005 mm) controls crosshatch spacing for optimized ablation performance. ---  API Changes New optional parameters added to convertCircuitJsonToLbrn: traceMargin?: number  Margin width (mm) for trace clearance (requires includeCopper: true) laserSpotSize?: number  Laser spot size (mm) for crosshatch spacing (default: 0.005mm) All parameters are fully optional and backward compatible. ---  Robustness Improvements More resilient boolean-ops handling for complex geometries that previously broke flatten-js Automatic fallback to per-polygon output when unioning fails Detailed warning logs help diagnose problematic trace shapes ---  Documentation Expanded README with full trace-margin workflow description Added examples, diagrams, and best-practice notes Documented all new API parameters and recommended usage patterns ---  Testing  Basic trace-margin test (simple horizontal trace)  Validation of invalid configurations (e.g., using traceMargin without copper)  Complex real-world circuit test (25-LED grid  ESP32)  All existing tests pass (4242) ---  Implementation Details Trace-margin generation works by: 1. Generating normal-width trace geometry (inner union) 2. Generating expanded-width geometry using width  2traceMargin (outer union) 3. Computing clearanceArea  outer  inner, producing margin rings 4. Exporting these areas as filled crosshatch Scan-mode shapes This design is highly efficient because it: Clears only the required isolation zonesnot entire copper layers Avoids error-prone manual offsetboolean geometry Uses LightBurns built-in optimized crosshatch engine Ensures reliable isolation by fully eliminating leftover conductive paths ---  Example Usage ts const lbrn  convertCircuitJsonToLbrn(circuitJson,  includeCopper: true, traceMargin: 0.2,  0.2mm clearance laserSpotSize: 0.005,  5m crosshatch spacing includeLayers: top, );  ---  Breaking Changes None. All new functionality is optional and preserves existing behavior. |

| PRs # | Impact | Rating | Description |
|------|--------|--------|-------------|
| [#614](https://github.com/tscircuit/3d-viewer/pull/614) | 🐳 Major | ⭐⭐⭐ | Adds full PCB texture support in JSCAD viewer, including soldermask, silkscreen, and traces, with improved layer visibility controls and consistent SVG export coloring. |
| [#442](https://github.com/tscircuit/circuit-to-svg/pull/442) | 🐳 Major | ⭐⭐⭐ | Adds full support for pcb_copper_text, including normal text rendering, mirroring, rotation, and knockout rectangles with text cutouts. Introduces opentype.js for true path extraction and updates snapshot tests. |
| [#525](https://github.com/tscircuit/pcb-viewer/pull/525) | 🐙 Minor | ⭐⭐ | Add support for rendering pcb_copper_text circuit-json elements, including automatic mirroring for bottom layer text, rotation support, and text alignment. Implement knockout text rendering feature that displays text as a cutout from a filled background rectangle, with configurable padding. |
| [#520](https://github.com/tscircuit/pcb-viewer/pull/520) | 🐙 Minor | ⭐⭐ | Fixes incorrect offset computation for pcb_panel placement, ensuring accurate positioning within PCB assemblies. |
| [#367](https://github.com/tscircuit/circuit-json/pull/367) | 🐙 Minor | ⭐⭐ | Adds an optional is_covered_with_solder_mask field to PcbPlatedHoleCircle, allowing explicit control of solder-mask coverage for plated holes. |
| [#71](https://github.com/tscircuit/circuit-json-util/pull/71) | 🐙 Minor | ⭐⭐ | Adds support for polygon-shaped SMT pads in both bounds and transform utilities, fixing PCB Auto Packing not working on polygon pads in core. |
| [#618](https://github.com/tscircuit/3d-viewer/pull/618) | 🐙 Minor | ⭐⭐ | Fixes rendering of JSCAD traces to use the same green trace-with-mask color as Manifold and positions them visually above the copper traces. |
| [#1722](https://github.com/tscircuit/core/pull/1722) | 🐙 Minor | ⭐⭐ | Changes the default panelization method from tab-routing to none in the Panel component. |
| [#1720](https://github.com/tscircuit/core/pull/1720) | 🐙 Minor | ⭐⭐ | Fixes issues with board positioning inside panels by using global PCB coordinates for layout, ensuring accurate absolute center computation for boards. |
| [#1713](https://github.com/tscircuit/core/pull/1713) | 🐙 Minor | ⭐⭐ | Refactors board inflation logic to rely on pcb_board entries only, replacing inflateSourceBoard with the new inflatePcbBoard and updating inflateCircuitJson accordingly. |
| [#1710](https://github.com/tscircuit/core/pull/1710) | 🐙 Minor | ⭐⭐ | Adds a new inflateSourceBoard inflator that creates a Board component from source_board entries in circuit-json. Prevents double-inflation when a board is already present. Wires board inflation into inflateCircuitJson to ensure boards render correctly in subcircuits. |
| [#444](https://github.com/tscircuit/circuit-to-svg/pull/444) | 🐙 Minor | ⭐⭐ | Adjusts the scaling of copper text to match the scale of silkscreen text in SVG rendering. |
| [#441](https://github.com/tscircuit/circuit-to-svg/pull/441) | 🐙 Minor | ⭐⭐ | Adds anchor-offset indicator rendering for PCB panels and fixes the Y-offset sign issue in createAnchorOffsetIndicators while updating tscircuit-related dependencies to their latest versions. |

|------|--------|--------|-------------|
| [#48](https://github.com/tscircuit/circuit-json-to-lbrn/pull/48) | 🐳 Major | ⭐⭐⭐⭐ | Summary This PR introduces a full multi-layer copper architecture featuring independent top and bottom copper processing, precise via-aware trace splitting, and flexible layer-selective export. These improvements elevate the converter to true multi-layer PCB capability and enable advanced manufacturing workflows such as selective laser cutting, single-side operations, and accurate double-sided production. Key Enhancements 1. Dedicated TopBottom Copper Layers Replaces the previous single copper pipeline Each layer receives its own geometry and cut settings Supports double-sided PCB workflows with proper layer isolation 2. Via-Aware Multi-Layer Trace Splitting Correctly segments traces at vias Distributes trace geometry to the appropriate copper layer Ensures accurate copper distribution across stackups 3. New includeLayers Option (with full examples) The converter now allows exporting any combination of copper layers: tsx  Process all layers (default) convertCircuitJsonToLbrn(circuitJson)  Process only top layer convertCircuitJsonToLbrn(circuitJson,  includeLayers: top )  Process only bottom layer convertCircuitJsonToLbrn(circuitJson,  includeLayers: bottom )  Process both layers explicitly (bottom, top is equivalent to default) convertCircuitJsonToLbrn(circuitJson,  includeLayers: bottom, top )  Supports single-sided manufacturing Allows explicit multi-layer selection Maintains full backward compatibility 4. Updated Element Handling SMT Pads: Routed based on layer property Traces: Grouped and processed by copper layer Vias  Plated Holes: Added to both copper layers  through-board layer Reflects real-world multi-layer PCB behavior Cut Settings Update Previous: Copper Through Board Soldermask New: Top Copper (index 0) Bottom Copper (index 1) Through Board (index 2) Soldermask (index 3) This provides granular control but introduces index changes. Motivation The previous single-layer approach prevented accurate multi-layer export, limiting: Side-specific laser settings Selective production of top or bottom side Correct representation of traces that change layers via vias This PR removes these limitations and establishes a robust, production-ready multi-layer pipeline. Testing  Validation  All 39 existing tests pass  Comprehensive multi-layer tests added (using keyboard-default60.json)  Verified trace splitting at vias  Verified per-layer filtering and geometry isolation Tested on a 183-trace multi-layer board: All layers  Top: 402, Bottom: 512, Through: 455 Top only  402  through-board Bottom only  512  through-board Both explicitly  Same as all layers Breaking Changes  Cut setting indices updated: Soldermask: 2  3 Through Board: 1  2 Projects that reference indices numerically may require updates. Conclusion This PR delivers a complete, robust multi-layer copper system, enabling precise topbottom separation, accurate via segmentation, and flexible layer inclusion for manufacturing workflows. It significantly improves correctness, configurability, and production readiness. |
| [#1719](https://github.com/tscircuit/core/pull/1719) | 🐙 Minor | ⭐⭐ | Fixes the issue where the Panel component ignored explicit width and height props, always replacing them with auto-sized values, thus preventing users from defining custom panel dimensions. |

| [#51](https://github.com/tscircuit/circuit-json-to-lbrn/pull/51) | 🐌 Tiny | Summary This PR introduces automated trace-margin rasterization, enabling precise laser-cut electrical-isolation zones around PCB traces. It generates accurate clearance regions and fills them with 45 crosshatched raster patterns using LightBurns Scan modesignificantly improving copper removal quality and fabrication reliability for laser-ablated PCBs. ---  Changes   New Features Automatic trace-margin clearance generation Computes the clearance area between normal-width traces and expanded traces (width  2margin) to create accurate isolation donut geometries. Crosshatch rasterization for copper removal Uses LightBurns Scan mode with a 45 crosshatch pattern for efficient and consistent margin ablation. Per-layer margin cut settings Provides dedicated cut settings for top and bottom copper clearances (LightBurn layer indices 4  5). Configurable laser spot size Laser spot size (default 0.005 mm) controls crosshatch spacing for optimized ablation performance. ---  API Changes New optional parameters added to convertCircuitJsonToLbrn: traceMargin?: number  Margin width (mm) for trace clearance (requires includeCopper: true) laserSpotSize?: number  Laser spot size (mm) for crosshatch spacing (default: 0.005mm) All parameters are fully optional and backward compatible. ---  Robustness Improvements More resilient boolean-ops handling for complex geometries that previously broke flatten-js Automatic fallback to per-polygon output when unioning fails Detailed warning logs help diagnose problematic trace shapes ---  Documentation Expanded README with full trace-margin workflow description Added examples, diagrams, and best-practice notes Documented all new API parameters and recommended usage patterns ---  Testing  Basic trace-margin test (simple horizontal trace)  Validation of invalid configurations (e.g., using traceMargin without copper)  Complex real-world circuit test (25-LED grid  ESP32)  All existing tests pass (4242) ---  Implementation Details Trace-margin generation works by: 1. Generating normal-width trace geometry (inner union) 2. Generating expanded-width geometry using width  2traceMargin (outer union) 3. Computing clearanceArea  outer  inner, producing margin rings 4. Exporting these areas as filled crosshatch Scan-mode shapes This design is highly efficient because it: Clears only the required isolation zonesnot entire copper layers Avoids error-prone manual offsetboolean geometry Uses LightBurns built-in optimized crosshatch engine Ensures reliable isolation by fully eliminating leftover conductive paths ---  Example Usage ts const lbrn  convertCircuitJsonToLbrn(circuitJson,  includeCopper: true, traceMargin: 0.2,  0.2mm clearance laserSpotSize: 0.005,  5m crosshatch spacing includeLayers: top, );  ---  Breaking Changes None. All new functionality is optional and preserves existing behavior. |

| [#364](https://github.com/tscircuit/tscircuit-autorouter/pull/364) | 🐳 Major | ⭐⭐⭐ | Adds automatic merging of physically connected traces into unified nets to improve routing topology. |
| [#358](https://github.com/tscircuit/tscircuit-autorouter/pull/358) | 🐳 Major | ⭐⭐⭐ | Refactors the route stitching logic and fixes layer assignment issues in the unravel solver by removing the RouteDirectionFixSubSolver, improving route stitching selection with a scoring system, adding Z-lock constraints for target nodes, and handling edge cases in the SingleSimplifiedPathSolver. |
| [#20](https://github.com/tscircuit/rectdiff/pull/20) | 🐳 Major | ⭐⭐⭐ | Implements support for board outlines in RectDiffSolver by treating the void space outside the outline as obstacles and includes visualization of the void areas. |
| [#17](https://github.com/tscircuit/rectdiff/pull/17) | 🐳 Major | ⭐⭐⭐ | Adds a new page to showcase the 2D outline visualization using SimpleRouteJson data for testing and demonstration. |
| [#16](https://github.com/tscircuit/rectdiff/pull/16) | 🐙 Minor | ⭐⭐ | Updates the visualize() method to draw the board outline as a closed loop of lines if srj.outline is present, falling back to the rectangular bounding box otherwise, providing a more accurate 2D representation for non-rectangular boards. |
