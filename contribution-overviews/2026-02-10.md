| PR # | Impact | Contributor | Description |
|------|--------|-------------|-------------|
| [#41](https://github.com/tscircuit/alphabet/pull/41) | 🐌 Tiny | Abse2001 | This PR refactors the SVG font pipeline to use DejaVu Sans Mono as the reference font and enforces strict monospace behavior across all glyphs. It replaces the previous Arial-based metric alignment, standardizes advance widths to ensure uniform character spacing, normalizes horizontal scaling, and improves baseline and descender consistency. Stroke weight and glyph positioning have been slightly refined for better visual balance, and snapshots were regenerated to reflect the updated metric system. |

| [#41](https://github.com/tscircuit/alphabet/pull/41) | 🐌 Tiny | This PR refactors the SVG font pipeline to use DejaVu Sans Mono as the reference font and enforces strict monospace behavior across all glyphs. It replaces the previous Arial-based metric alignment, standardizes advance widths to ensure uniform character spacing, normalizes horizontal scaling, and improves baseline and descender consistency. Stroke weight and glyph positioning have been slightly refined for better visual balance, and snapshots were regenerated to reflect the updated metric system. |
| [#169](https://github.com/tscircuit/circuit-to-canvas/pull/169) | 🐌 Tiny | Fixes typos in the drawSoldermaskTop and drawSoldermaskBottom options in the CircuitToCanvasDrawer interface and related tests. |
