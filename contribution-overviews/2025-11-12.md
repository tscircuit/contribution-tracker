## Scoring & Sponsorship System

### Overview

PRs are analyzed by AI and assigned a **star rating (1-3 stars)**. 4 and 5 star ratings can only be manually assigned by staff. Weekly scores use `2^(starRating - 1)` per PR (capped at 12 PRs per rating), plus review/discussion points.

### Weekly Score → Star String

| Score Range | Star String | Count Value |
|------------|-------------|-------------|
| 0-3 | (empty) | 0 stars |
| 4-10 | ⭐ | 1 star |
| 11-30 | ⭐⭐ | 2 stars |
| 31-50 | ⭐⭐⭐ | 3 stars |
| 51-75 | 👑 | 1 crown |
| 76-100 | 👑👑 | 2 crowns |
| 101+ | 👑👑👑 | 3 crowns |

> Crowns count as 3 stars for sponsorship.

### Monthly Sponsorship Calculation

The sponsorship system calculates monthly payments based on your **weekly star counts** over the complete weeks in that month (typically 4-5 weeks, Wednesday-Tuesday format).

**Step 1: Collect Weekly Stars**
- All complete weeks in the month are analyzed
- Each week's star string is converted to a numeric count (⭐ = 1 star, ⭐⭐⭐ = 3 stars)
- Example: `[2, 2, 2, 1, 0]` means 2 stars in week 1, 2 stars in week 2, etc.

**Step 2: Calculate Metrics**
- **Median stars**: The median value of all weekly star counts
- **Min stars**: The minimum weekly star count
- **Max stars**: The maximum weekly star count
- **High score**: The maximum raw weekly score (0-100+ range from the scoring table) from any week in the month

**Step 3: Determine Base Amount**
The sponsorship amount is calculated based on these metrics (checked in order):

| Condition | Base Amount |
|-----------|-------------|
| `minStarCount >= 3` | **$500** |
| `medianStars >= 3` | **$450** |
| `medianStars >= 2.5` | **$300** |
| `medianStars >= 2` | **$200** |
| `medianStars >= 1.5` | **$100** |
| `medianStars >= 1` | **$75** |
| `maxStarCount >= 2` | **$25** |
| `maxStarCount >= 1` | **$15** |
| `highScore >= 3` (and all stars = 0) | **$5** |

| Maintainer Level | Monthly Bonus |
|------------------|---------------|
| Level 1 | **$200** |
| Level 2 | **$350** |
| Level 3 | **$500** |

**Final Amount** = Base Amount + Maintainer Bonus

Key Changes Introduced getElementsOutsideTree() to detect plated holes and other PCB elements not included in the circuit tree. Added these elements to packOutput.obstacles, ensuring pack solvers respect board-level geometry. Defaulted opts.obstacles to an empty array for safer merging. Updated repro pages and tests to demonstrate the new behavior. This ensures pack placement no longer overlaps with board-level plated holes or outline geometry, fixing incorrect placements and improving solver stability. |

| PRs # | Impact | Rating | Description |
|------|--------|--------|-------------|
| [#68](https://github.com/tscircuit/calculate-packing/pull/68) | 🐳 Major | ⭐⭐⭐ | This PR improves the packing pipeline by automatically detecting board-level elements that are not part of the component tree and adding them as packing obstacles. Key Changes Introduced getElementsOutsideTree() to detect plated holes and other PCB elements not included in the circuit tree. Added these elements to packOutput.obstacles, ensuring pack solvers respect board-level geometry. Defaulted opts.obstacles to an empty array for safer merging. Updated repro pages and tests to demonstrate the new behavior. This ensures pack placement no longer overlaps with board-level plated holes or outline geometry, fixing incorrect placements and improving solver stability. |
| [#24](https://github.com/tscircuit/kicad-to-circuit-json/pull/24) | 🐳 Major | ⭐⭐⭐ | This PR enhances the KiCad-to-CircuitJSON converter by introducing full source_component creation, automatic referencevalue extraction, component-type inference, and stable UUID-based mapping. It also fixes source-port assignment by correctly linking ports to their corresponding source_component_id. New helpers were added for reading footprint referencesvalues, inferring component types, and tracking footprint UUID  source component relationships. |
| [#1663](https://github.com/tscircuit/core/pull/1663) | 🐙 Minor | ⭐⭐ | Adds the ability for subcircuits to inflate transistor components from Circuit JSON. |
