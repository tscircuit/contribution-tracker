It adds a new operation type for changing passive orientation, modifies the target netlist to ensure compatibility with the template's passive structures, and includes tests to verify the correct application of these changes. The changes allow for better adaptation of circuit templates to match the expected passive configurations, enhancing the overall flexibility and usability of the circuit design tool. | ❌ |
| [#8](https://github.com/tscircuit/pmars-layout/pull/8) | 🐙 Minor | This pull request introduces a public API, initial end-to-end testing for the MA (Model Adaptation) functionality, and various fixes related to adaptation processes and passive offset issues. It includes new files for testing guidelines and architecture overview, as well as updates to existing files to improve functionality and documentation. | ✅ |
| [#5](https://github.com/tscircuit/pmars-layout/pull/5) | 🐙 Minor | This pull request introduces a set of new functionalities for adapting circuit templates to match target netlists. It includes the addition of various edit operations such as adding labels to pins, adding and removing pins from sides, and clearing pins. The changes are primarily focused on enhancing the adaptability of circuit templates, allowing for better alignment with specified target configurations. | ✅ |

| [#824](https://github.com/tscircuit/core/pull/824) | 🐙 Minor | This pull request introduces a new testing matcher `toMatch3dSnapshot` for circuit JSON objects, utilizing the `simple-3d-svg` library. It allows for the creation of 3D snapshots of circuit designs, enhancing the testing capabilities of the project. The changes include updates to the package.json to include new dependencies and modifications to test files to implement the new matcher. | ❌ |

| [#1148](https://github.com/tscircuit/tscircuit.com/pull/1148) | 🐙 Minor | This pull request modifies the CodeEditor component to make it interactive even when full type checking is not yet ready. It removes the state management for `isCodeEditorReady`, allowing the editor to be fully functional without waiting for type checking to complete. This change enhances the user experience by providing immediate interactivity in the code editor. | ✅ |
| [#634](https://github.com/tscircuit/runframe/pull/634) | 🐙 Minor | This pull request addresses an issue where the 'Errors' tab fails to display error details on the first execution of user code in a fresh application load. The fix modifies the conditional rendering for the 'Errors' tab content to ensure that errors from an initial failed run are shown, by displaying the 'ErrorTabContent' if either the 'errorMessage' prop is present or if 'circuitJsonErrors' indicates errors. | ❌ |
