## Scoring & Sponsorship System

### Overview

PRs are analyzed by AI and assigned a **star rating (1-3 stars)**. 4 and 5 star ratings can only be manually assigned by staff. Weekly scores use `2^(starRating - 1)` per PR (capped at 12 PRs per rating), plus review/discussion points.

### Weekly Score → Star String

| Score Range | Star String | Count Value |
|------------|-------------|-------------|
| 0-3 | (empty) | 0 stars |
| 4-10 | ⭐ | 1 star |
| 11-30 | ⭐⭐ | 2 stars |
| 31-50 | ⭐⭐⭐ | 3 stars |
| 51-75 | 👑 | 1 crown |
| 76-100 | 👑👑 | 2 crowns |
| 101+ | 👑👑👑 | 3 crowns |

> Crowns count as 3 stars for sponsorship.

### Monthly Sponsorship Calculation

The sponsorship system calculates monthly payments based on your **weekly star counts** over the complete weeks in that month (typically 4-5 weeks, Wednesday-Tuesday format).

**Step 1: Collect Weekly Stars**
- All complete weeks in the month are analyzed
- Each week's star string is converted to a numeric count (⭐ = 1 star, ⭐⭐⭐ = 3 stars)
- Example: `[2, 2, 2, 1, 0]` means 2 stars in week 1, 2 stars in week 2, etc.

**Step 2: Calculate Metrics**
- **Median stars**: The median value of all weekly star counts
- **Min stars**: The minimum weekly star count
- **Max stars**: The maximum weekly star count
- **High score**: The maximum raw weekly score (0-100+ range from the scoring table) from any week in the month

**Step 3: Determine Base Amount**
The sponsorship amount is calculated based on these metrics (checked in order):

| Condition | Base Amount |
|-----------|-------------|
| `minStarCount >= 3` | **$500** |
| `medianStars >= 3` | **$450** |
| `medianStars >= 2.5` | **$300** |
| `medianStars >= 2` | **$200** |
| `medianStars >= 1.5` | **$100** |
| `medianStars >= 1` | **$75** |
| `maxStarCount >= 2` | **$25** |
| `maxStarCount >= 1` | **$15** |
| `highScore >= 3` (and all stars = 0) | **$5** |

| Maintainer Level | Monthly Bonus |
|------------------|---------------|
| Level 1 | **$200** |
| Level 2 | **$350** |
| Level 3 | **$500** |

**Final Amount** = Base Amount + Maintainer Bonus

| [#1612](https://github.com/tscircuit/core/pull/1612) | 🐳 Major | ⭐⭐⭐ | ShiboSoftwareDev | This commit refactors the CopperPour component by moving it into its own dedicated module under libcomponentsprimitive-componentsCopperPour. The internal logic for generating the pour has been split into smaller, more manageable utility functions: get-board-polygon.ts, get-trace-obstacles.ts, process-obstacles.ts, generate-and-insert-brep.ts. This change improves code organization and modularity without altering any functionality. It serves as a preparatory step for further improvements to the copper pour rendering process. |

I am just moving out to run globally. This fixes it a lot, but Im not claiming this because the fix is non-standard. After this, I would look inside the _TraceOverlapShiftSolver_ to see if I could improve that! I feel a mix of both of them will be great and solve the issue best |

| PRs # | Impact | Rating | Description |
|------|--------|--------|-------------|
| [#438](https://github.com/tscircuit/pcb-viewer/pull/438) | 🐳 Major | ⭐⭐⭐ | Adds an option in the View dropdown menu to toggle the visibility of copper pours, with the state saved in local storage for user preference persistence. |
| [#1612](https://github.com/tscircuit/core/pull/1612) | 🐳 Major | ⭐⭐⭐ | This commit refactors the CopperPour component by moving it into its own dedicated module under libcomponentsprimitive-componentsCopperPour. The internal logic for generating the pour has been split into smaller, more manageable utility functions: get-board-polygon.ts, get-trace-obstacles.ts, process-obstacles.ts, generate-and-insert-brep.ts. This change improves code organization and modularity without altering any functionality. It serves as a preparatory step for further improvements to the copper pour rendering process. |
| [#411](https://github.com/tscircuit/circuit-to-svg/pull/411) | 🐳 Major | ⭐⭐⭐ | Adds a showErrorsInTextOverlay option to SVG conversion functions to render error messages directly on the SVG output for debugging purposes. |
| [#409](https://github.com/tscircuit/circuit-to-svg/pull/409) | 🐳 Major | ⭐⭐⭐ | Adds support for rendering multi-board panels, refactors numeric parsing to use distance.parse, and fixes a bug in bounds calculation for polygon pads. |
| [#443](https://github.com/tscircuit/pcb-viewer/pull/443) | 🐙 Minor | ⭐⭐ | Fixes rendering order to ensure drill and foreground layers consistently appear on top by simplifying z-index management in the orderAndFadeLayers method. |
| [#434](https://github.com/tscircuit/pcb-viewer/pull/434) | 🐙 Minor | ⭐⭐ | Makes copper pours slightly transparent to distinguish them from other copper elements. |
| [#335](https://github.com/tscircuit/circuit-json/pull/335) | 🐙 Minor | ⭐⭐ | Adds a new element to represent unknown errors that occur during a simulation experiment, allowing simulation failures to be included in the circuit JSON document. |
| [#514](https://github.com/tscircuit/svg.tscircuit.com/pull/514) | 🐙 Minor | ⭐⭐ | Makes the simulation_experiment_id parameter optional for the schematic simulation SVG handler, automatically determining it from the circuit JSON if not provided. |

| [#1435](https://github.com/tscircuit/eval/pull/1435) | 🐙 Minor | ⭐⭐ | Changes the maximum import depth from 5 to 30 and throws an error when the maximum depth is reached instead of logging a message silently. |

| [#544](https://github.com/tscircuit/3d-viewer/pull/544) | 🐳 Major | ⭐⭐⭐ | Stores the auto-rotate preference in localStorage, allowing users to retain their settings across sessions. |
| [#1615](https://github.com/tscircuit/runframe/pull/1615) | 🐳 Major | ⭐⭐⭐ | Add support for uploading GLB and other binary files, enabling users to integrate 3D models into their projects. |
| [#16](https://github.com/tscircuit/kicadts/pull/16) | 🐳 Major | ⭐⭐⭐ | Adds a new Polyline class and extends it for use as SymbolPolyline, enabling support for polylines in schematic and symbol contexts. |
| [#4](https://github.com/tscircuit/kicad-to-circuit-json/pull/4) | 🐳 Major | ⭐⭐⭐ | This pull request introduces support for KiCad PCB files that utilize UUIDs under the tstamp field. The changes ensure that if a footprint does not have a UUID, the tstamp value will be used instead. This is crucial for maintaining compatibility with various PCB designs that may not conform to the expected UUID structure. Additionally, the changes include adjustments to how pad layers are determined and how pads are processed, ensuring that the system can handle both raw arrays and KiCad layer objects effectively. |
| [#1622](https://github.com/tscircuit/runframe/pull/1622) | 🐙 Minor | ⭐⭐ | Fixes the bug report textarea from causing the entire FileMenuLeftHeader to re-render on every key press by switching to uncontrolled input. |
| [#15](https://github.com/tscircuit/kicadts/pull/15) | 🐙 Minor | ⭐⭐ | Enables the NoConnect class to have child tokens and be included in the KicadSch class, enhancing the structure of schematic representations. |
| [#17](https://github.com/tscircuit/kicadts/pull/17) | 🐙 Minor | ⭐⭐ | Adds support for a mirror property under the parent Symbol in the schematic representation, allowing for mirroring of symbols along the x or y axis. |
| [#14](https://github.com/tscircuit/kicadts/pull/14) | 🐙 Minor | ⭐⭐ | Adds support for bold and italic text effects in the TextEffectsFont class. |
| [#5](https://github.com/tscircuit/kicad-to-circuit-json/pull/5) | 🐙 Minor | ⭐⭐ | This pull request addresses an issue where the reference text in the KiCad PCB was being skipped when converting to the circuit JSON format. The change ensures that the reference is included in the output, which is crucial for accurate representation of the PCB design. |

I am just moving out to run globally. This fixes it a lot, but Im not claiming this because the fix is non-standard. After this, I would look inside the _TraceOverlapShiftSolver_ to see if I could improve that! I feel a mix of both of them will be great and solve the issue best |
