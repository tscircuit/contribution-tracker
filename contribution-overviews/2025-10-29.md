## Scoring & Sponsorship System

### Overview

PRs are analyzed by AI and assigned a **star rating (1-3 stars)**. 4 and 5 star ratings can only be manually assigned by staff. Weekly scores use `2^(starRating - 1)` per PR (capped at 12 PRs per rating), plus review/discussion points.

### Weekly Score → Star String

| Score Range | Star String | Count Value |
|------------|-------------|-------------|
| 0-3 | (empty) | 0 stars |
| 4-10 | ⭐ | 1 star |
| 11-30 | ⭐⭐ | 2 stars |
| 31-50 | ⭐⭐⭐ | 3 stars |
| 51-75 | 👑 | 1 crown |
| 76-100 | 👑👑 | 2 crowns |
| 101+ | 👑👑👑 | 3 crowns |

> Crowns count as 3 stars for sponsorship.

### Monthly Sponsorship Calculation

The sponsorship system calculates monthly payments based on your **weekly star counts** over the complete weeks in that month (typically 4-5 weeks, Wednesday-Tuesday format).

**Step 1: Collect Weekly Stars**
- All complete weeks in the month are analyzed
- Each week's star string is converted to a numeric count (⭐ = 1 star, ⭐⭐⭐ = 3 stars)
- Example: `[2, 2, 2, 1, 0]` means 2 stars in week 1, 2 stars in week 2, etc.

**Step 2: Calculate Metrics**
- **Median stars**: The median value of all weekly star counts
- **Min stars**: The minimum weekly star count
- **Max stars**: The maximum weekly star count
- **High score**: The maximum raw weekly score (0-100+ range from the scoring table) from any week in the month

**Step 3: Determine Base Amount**
The sponsorship amount is calculated based on these metrics (checked in order):

| Condition | Base Amount |
|-----------|-------------|
| `minStarCount >= 3` | **$500** |
| `medianStars >= 3` | **$450** |
| `medianStars >= 2.5` | **$300** |
| `medianStars >= 2` | **$200** |
| `medianStars >= 1.5` | **$100** |
| `medianStars >= 1` | **$75** |
| `maxStarCount >= 2` | **$25** |
| `maxStarCount >= 1` | **$15** |
| `highScore >= 3` (and all stars = 0) | **$5** |

| Maintainer Level | Monthly Bonus |
|------------------|---------------|
| Level 1 | **$200** |
| Level 2 | **$350** |
| Level 3 | **$500** |

**Final Amount** = Base Amount + Maintainer Bonus

| [#4](https://github.com/tscircuit/kicad-to-circuit-json/pull/4) | 🐳 Major | ⭐⭐⭐ | imrishabh18 | This pull request introduces support for KiCad PCB files that utilize UUIDs under the tstamp field. The changes ensure that if a footprint does not have a UUID, the tstamp value will be used instead. This is crucial for maintaining compatibility with various PCB designs that may not conform to the expected UUID structure. Additionally, the changes include adjustments to how pad layers are determined and how pads are processed, ensuring that the system can handle both raw arrays and KiCad layer objects effectively. |
| [#7](https://github.com/tscircuit/kicad-to-circuit-json/pull/7) | 🐙 Minor | ⭐⭐ | imrishabh18 | Adds an initial schematic parity test for the pic_programmer by making fixes in kicadts for the kicad_sch file to be parseable. |
| [#5](https://github.com/tscircuit/kicad-to-circuit-json/pull/5) | 🐙 Minor | ⭐⭐ | imrishabh18 | This pull request addresses an issue where the reference text in the KiCad PCB was being skipped when converting to the circuit JSON format. The change ensures that the reference is included in the output, which is crucial for accurate representation of the PCB design. |

| [#89](https://github.com/tscircuit/schematic-trace-solver/pull/89) | 🐙 Minor | ⭐⭐ | 0hmX | ref: https:github.comtscircuitschematic-trace-solverissues87issuecomment-3463136963 We had a subsolver step, which was responsible for removing redundant angles in the schematic trace. I am just moving out to run globally. This fixes it a lot, but Im not claiming this because the fix is non-standard. After this, I would look inside the _TraceOverlapShiftSolver_ to see if I could improve that! I feel a mix of both of them will be great and solve the issue best |

| [#251](https://github.com/tscircuit/contribution-tracker/pull/251) | 🐌 Tiny | This update simplifies the Scoring  Sponsorship System in the README by condensing explanations into a shorter, skimmable format while keeping the key tables. It clarifies how weekly scores map to star strings, how monthly sponsorship is calculated from weekly star counts (including medianminmax logic and highScore fallback), and adds a clear table for maintainer bonuses by level. Crowns are explicitly noted as counting as 3 stars for sponsorship. |

I am just moving out to run globally. This fixes it a lot, but Im not claiming this because the fix is non-standard. After this, I would look inside the _TraceOverlapShiftSolver_ to see if I could improve that! I feel a mix of both of them will be great and solve the issue best |
