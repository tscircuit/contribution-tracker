## Scoring & Sponsorship System

### Overview

PRs are analyzed by AI and assigned a **star rating (1-3 stars)**. 4 and 5 star ratings can only be manually assigned by staff. Weekly scores use `2^(starRating - 1)` per PR (capped at 12 PRs per rating), plus review/discussion points.

### Weekly Score → Star String

| Score Range | Star String | Count Value |
|------------|-------------|-------------|
| 0-3 | (empty) | 0 stars |
| 4-10 | ⭐ | 1 star |
| 11-30 | ⭐⭐ | 2 stars |
| 31-50 | ⭐⭐⭐ | 3 stars |
| 51-75 | 👑 | 1 crown |
| 76-100 | 👑👑 | 2 crowns |
| 101+ | 👑👑👑 | 3 crowns |

> Crowns count as 3 stars for sponsorship.

### Monthly Sponsorship Calculation

The sponsorship system calculates monthly payments based on your **weekly star counts** over the complete weeks in that month (typically 4-5 weeks, Wednesday-Tuesday format).

**Step 1: Collect Weekly Stars**
- All complete weeks in the month are analyzed
- Each week's star string is converted to a numeric count (⭐ = 1 star, ⭐⭐⭐ = 3 stars)
- Example: `[2, 2, 2, 1, 0]` means 2 stars in week 1, 2 stars in week 2, etc.

**Step 2: Calculate Metrics**
- **Median stars**: The median value of all weekly star counts
- **Min stars**: The minimum weekly star count
- **Max stars**: The maximum weekly star count
- **High score**: The maximum raw weekly score (0-100+ range from the scoring table) from any week in the month

**Step 3: Determine Base Amount**
The sponsorship amount is calculated based on these metrics (checked in order):

| Condition | Base Amount |
|-----------|-------------|
| `minStarCount >= 3` | **$500** |
| `medianStars >= 3` | **$450** |
| `medianStars >= 2.5` | **$300** |
| `medianStars >= 2` | **$200** |
| `medianStars >= 1.5` | **$100** |
| `medianStars >= 1` | **$75** |
| `maxStarCount >= 2` | **$25** |
| `maxStarCount >= 1` | **$15** |
| `highScore >= 3` (and all stars = 0) | **$5** |

| Maintainer Level | Monthly Bonus |
|------------------|---------------|
| Level 1 | **$200** |
| Level 2 | **$350** |
| Level 3 | **$500** |

**Final Amount** = Base Amount + Maintainer Bonus
