# Changelog 2026-02

- Full PCB courtyard support (circle, rectangle, outline) across core, viewers and converters – visible in PCB viewer, SVG/Canvas renders and KiCad output ([pcb-viewer #644](https://github.com/tscircuit/pcb-viewer/pull/644), [core #1901](https://github.com/tscircuit/core/pull/1901))
- New pcbSx sub-panel footprint system with initial tooling and docs ([core #1908](https://github.com/tscircuit/core/pull/1908), [props #584](https://github.com/tscircuit/props/pull/584))
- Added MountedBoard component + screen support for embedded boards and modules ([core #1918](https://github.com/tscircuit/core/pull/1918), [footprinter #496](https://github.com/tscircuit/footprinter/pull/496))
- Knock-out silkscreen text supported in SVG/Canvas exports and mapped in core ([circuit-to-svg #506](https://github.com/tscircuit/circuit-to-svg/pull/506), [circuit-to-canvas #159](https://github.com/tscircuit/circuit-to-canvas/pull/159))
- Manual routing improvements: vias allowed in pcbPath and elimination of false DRC trace-overlap errors ([core #1899](https://github.com/tscircuit/core/pull/1899), [core #1916](https://github.com/tscircuit/core/pull/1916))
- 3D viewer performance & correctness: cached STEP blobs, capped texture resolution, bottom-layer alignment fix, GPU-leak prevention and asset-path resolver ([3d-viewer #675](https://github.com/tscircuit/3d-viewer/pull/675), [3d-viewer #680](https://github.com/tscircuit/3d-viewer/pull/680))
- PCB viewer visual fixes: traces no longer cover plated holes, brighter solder-mask traces, minimum 2 px board-outline stroke to stay visible ([pcb-viewer #646](https://github.com/tscircuit/pcb-viewer/pull/646), [pcb-viewer #652](https://github.com/tscircuit/pcb-viewer/pull/652))
- Schematic viewer: live-update debug grid & improved port props ([schematic-viewer #163](https://github.com/tscircuit/schematic-viewer/pull/163))
- CLI quality-of-life: new `tsci doctor` diagnostics, `--glbs` flag to emit GLB models, and fatal error builds now exit with code 1 ([cli #1893](https://github.com/tscircuit/cli/pull/1893), [cli #1952](https://github.com/tscircuit/cli/pull/1952))
- KiCad exporter upgrades: 4-layer board support, correct inner-layer routing, fabrication note text, potentiometer symbol/footprint generation and duplicate-symbol de-dup ([circuit-json-to-kicad #110](https://github.com/tscircuit/circuit-json-to-kicad/pull/110), [circuit-json-to-kicad #128](https://github.com/tscircuit/circuit-json-to-kicad/pull/128))
- STEP export accuracy: correct pill/rotated-pill PCB holes and remove degenerate outlines to fix invalid STEP edges ([circuit-json-to-step #50](https://github.com/tscircuit/circuit-json-to-step/pull/50))
- Graphics engine overhaul: consistent stroke width on zoom plus first-class polygon support and per-polygon stroke widths ([graphics-debug #93](https://github.com/tscircuit/graphics-debug/pull/93), [graphics-debug #95](https://github.com/tscircuit/graphics-debug/pull/95))
- Hypergraph tools: polygon regions visualisation and selective route ripping for advanced autorouting workflows ([hypergraph #42](https://github.com/tscircuit/hypergraph/pull/42))
- New component/port props: broader schematic fill colors, inversion-circle option, configurable stem length, off-board allowance and reusable URL schema ([props #587](https://github.com/tscircuit/props/pull/587), [circuit-json #458](https://github.com/tscircuit/circuit-json/pull/458))
- Footprint library updates: new VSON footprint, enhanced SOP-8 definition and modernised JST naming (drops legacy `_shN`) ([footprinter #500](https://github.com/tscircuit/footprinter/pull/500), [footprinter #505](https://github.com/tscircuit/footprinter/pull/505))
