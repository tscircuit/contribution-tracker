# Changelog 2026-02

- Schematic viewer live-debug grid and improved port props ([schematic-viewer#163](https://github.com/tscircuit/schematic-viewer/pull/163))
- PCB courtyard element fully supported end-to-end (circle/rect/outline, top & bottom layers) across core and viewers ([core#1907](https://github.com/tscircuit/core/pull/1907), [core#1892](https://github.com/tscircuit/core/pull/1892), [core#1901](https://github.com/tscircuit/core/pull/1901), [pcb-viewer#644](https://github.com/tscircuit/pcb-viewer/pull/644), [svg.tscircuit.com#979](https://github.com/tscircuit/svg.tscircuit.com/pull/979))
- pcbPath now accepts via entries, enabling thru-hole segments in manual routing ([props#578](https://github.com/tscircuit/props/pull/578), [core#1899](https://github.com/tscircuit/core/pull/1899))

- Relative PCB placement with `calc()` expressions (e.g. `pcbX="calc(R1.pin1.x+2mm)"`) ([core#1928](https://github.com/tscircuit/core/pull/1928), [core#1929](https://github.com/tscircuit/core/pull/1929))
- pcb-viewer rendering fixes: traces no longer cover plated holes, brighter solder-mask traces, minimum outline stroke, correct layer order ([pcb-viewer#646](https://github.com/tscircuit/pcb-viewer/pull/646), [pcb-viewer#648](https://github.com/tscircuit/pcb-viewer/pull/648), [pcb-viewer#652](https://github.com/tscircuit/pcb-viewer/pull/652), [pcb-viewer#661](https://github.com/tscircuit/pcb-viewer/pull/661))
- 3D viewer speed & asset boosts: STEP blob caching, texture-resolution cap, correct bottom-side offsets, `resolveStaticAsset` support, unified board textures ([3d-viewer#675](https://github.com/tscircuit/3d-viewer/pull/675), [3d-viewer#672](https://github.com/tscircuit/3d-viewer/pull/672), [3d-viewer#674](https://github.com/tscircuit/3d-viewer/pull/674), [3d-viewer#680](https://github.com/tscircuit/3d-viewer/pull/680), [3d-viewer#686](https://github.com/tscircuit/3d-viewer/pull/686))
- Circuit-to-canvas re-architected solder-mask rendering with correct draw order ([circuit-to-canvas#163](https://github.com/tscircuit/circuit-to-canvas/pull/163))
- STEP export fixes: pill & rotated-pill hole geometry, degenerate outline removal ([circuit-json-to-step#50](https://github.com/tscircuit/circuit-json-to-step/pull/50), [circuit-json-to-step#48](https://github.com/tscircuit/circuit-json-to-step/pull/48))
- KiCad export: four-layer boards, correct multi-layer trace segments, potentiometer symbol/footprint generation, duplicate-port cleanup ([circuit-json-to-kicad#110](https://github.com/tscircuit/circuit-json-to-kicad/pull/110), [#117](https://github.com/tscircuit/circuit-json-to-kicad/pull/117), [#128](https://github.com/tscircuit/circuit-json-to-kicad/pull/128), [#126](https://github.com/tscircuit/circuit-json-to-kicad/pull/126))
- CLI enhancements: `tsci doctor` diagnostics, fatal build errors exit, new `--glbs` flag to generate GLB 3D models ([cli#1893](https://github.com/tscircuit/cli/pull/1893), [cli#1879](https://github.com/tscircuit/cli/pull/1879), [cli#1952](https://github.com/tscircuit/cli/pull/1952))
- Graphics-debug: consistent stroke width on zoom and per-polygon stroke control ([graphics-debug#93](https://github.com/tscircuit/graphics-debug/pull/93), [graphics-debug#97](https://github.com/tscircuit/graphics-debug/pull/97))
