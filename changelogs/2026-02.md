# Changelog 2026-02

- Fixed live-debug grid & port-prop rendering glitches in schematic viewer ([[tscircuit/schematic-viewer #163](https://github.com/tscircuit/schematic-viewer/pull/163)](https://github.com/tscircuit/schematic-viewer/pull/163))
- PCB viewer improvements:
  • Plated holes now appear above traces ([pcb-viewer #646](https://github.com/tscircuit/pcb-viewer/pull/646))
  • Courtyard layers rendered ([#644](https://github.com/tscircuit/pcb-viewer/pull/644))
  • Traces on solder-mask layer shown in bright green ([#648](https://github.com/tscircuit/pcb-viewer/pull/648))
  • Board outline always ≥ 2 px for visibility ([#652](https://github.com/tscircuit/pcb-viewer/pull/652))
- Full PCB-courtyard support (outline, rect, circle) across engine & exporters ([core #1907](https://github.com/tscircuit/core/pull/1907); [#1901](https://github.com/tscircuit/core/pull/1901); [#1892](https://github.com/tscircuit/core/pull/1892); SVG [#505](https://github.com/tscircuit/circuit-to-svg/pull/505); Canvas [#147](https://github.com/tscircuit/circuit-to-canvas/pull/147) etc.)
- New `pcbSx` size-hint prop with initial engine support ([props #584](https://github.com/tscircuit/props/pull/584); core [#1908](https://github.com/tscircuit/core/pull/1908))
- Manual routing: vias now allowed inside `pcbPath` definitions ([props #578](https://github.com/tscircuit/props/pull/578); core [#1899](https://github.com/tscircuit/core/pull/1899))
- 3D viewer upgrades: STEP model URL caching, bottom-layer alignment fix, auto-scaled textures, GPU-leak fix, relative asset paths & correct z-offset ([3d-viewer #675](https://github.com/tscircuit/3d-viewer/pull/675), [#674](https://github.com/tscircuit/3d-viewer/pull/674), [#672](https://github.com/tscircuit/3d-viewer/pull/672), [#673](https://github.com/tscircuit/3d-viewer/pull/673), [#680](https://github.com/tscircuit/3d-viewer/pull/680), [#682](https://github.com/tscircuit/3d-viewer/pull/682))
- STEP export: correct geometry for pill & rotated-pill holes and invalid outlines eliminated ([circuit-json-to-step #50](https://github.com/tscircuit/circuit-json-to-step/pull/50); [#48](https://github.com/tscircuit/circuit-json-to-step/pull/48))
- KiCad exporter fixes & features: proper multi-layer trace layers, deduped ports, and automatic potentiometer symbol/footprint generation ([circuit-json-to-kicad #117](https://github.com/tscircuit/circuit-json-to-kicad/pull/117), [#126](https://github.com/tscircuit/circuit-json-to-kicad/pull/126), [#128](https://github.com/tscircuit/circuit-json-to-kicad/pull/128))
- Canvas/SVG renderers: knockout silkscreen text rendering plus trace-soldermask & board-outline visibility fixes ([circuit-to-canvas #159](https://github.com/tscircuit/circuit-to-canvas/pull/159); [#153](https://github.com/tscircuit/circuit-to-canvas/pull/153); SVG [#506](https://github.com/tscircuit/circuit-to-svg/pull/506))
- Core engine: removed false trace-overlap DRC errors & disabled autoroute/layout for inflated subcircuits ([core #1916](https://github.com/tscircuit/core/pull/1916); [#1903](https://github.com/tscircuit/core/pull/1903))
- Footprinter: new VSON footprint, refined SOP-8 & JST syntax update, and SOD-123F fix ([footprinter #500](https://github.com/tscircuit/footprinter/pull/500); [#430](https://github.com/tscircuit/footprinter/pull/430); [#505](https://github.com/tscircuit/footprinter/pull/505); [#503](https://github.com/tscircuit/footprinter/pull/503))
- CLI enhancements:
  • `tsci doctor` diagnostics command ([cli #1893](https://github.com/tscircuit/cli/pull/1893))
  • Build fails on fatal errors ([#1879](https://github.com/tscircuit/cli/pull/1879))
  • `--glbs` flag to generate GLB 3D models during build ([#1952](https://github.com/tscircuit/cli/pull/1952))
  • Safer handling of missing package.json & correct GLB asset paths ([#1887](https://github.com/tscircuit/cli/pull/1887); [#1936](https://github.com/tscircuit/cli/pull/1936))
- Status tooling: `tsci init -y` now points to correct build file without noisy echo ([status #65](https://github.com/tscircuit/status/pull/65))
