# Changelog 2026-02

- Full PCB courtyard support (rect, circle, outline + bottom layer) now available across the stack – Core, viewers and all exporters ([pcb-viewer#644](https://github.com/tscircuit/pcb-viewer/pull/644), [core#1907](https://github.com/tscircuit/core/pull/1907), [circuit-json#454](https://github.com/tscircuit/circuit-json/pull/454), [circuit-to-svg#505](https://github.com/tscircuit/circuit-to-svg/pull/505), [circuit-to-canvas#151](https://github.com/tscircuit/circuit-to-canvas/pull/151), [circuit-json-to-kicad#122](https://github.com/tscircuit/circuit-json-to-kicad/pull/122))
- Manual pcbPath routes can now include vias with end-to-end viewer & KiCad support ([core#1899](https://github.com/tscircuit/core/pull/1899), [props#578](https://github.com/tscircuit/props/pull/578), [circuit-json-to-kicad#117](https://github.com/tscircuit/circuit-json-to-kicad/pull/117))
- Knock-out silkscreen text rendering added to Core, SVG & Canvas exporters ([core#1886](https://github.com/tscircuit/core/pull/1886), [circuit-to-svg#506](https://github.com/tscircuit/circuit-to-svg/pull/506), [circuit-to-canvas#159](https://github.com/tscircuit/circuit-to-canvas/pull/159))
- New pcbSx board-sizing helper prop with initial Core & Props support ([core#1908](https://github.com/tscircuit/core/pull/1908), [props#584](https://github.com/tscircuit/props/pull/584))
- 3D Viewer performance & stability: STEP model caching, texture resolution cap, GPU-leak fix, correct bottom-layer alignment and relative asset URLs ([3d-viewer#675](https://github.com/tscircuit/3d-viewer/pull/675), [3d-viewer#672](https://github.com/tscircuit/3d-viewer/pull/672), [3d-viewer#673](https://github.com/tscircuit/3d-viewer/pull/673), [3d-viewer#674](https://github.com/tscircuit/3d-viewer/pull/674), [3d-viewer#680](https://github.com/tscircuit/3d-viewer/pull/680))
- PCB Viewer UX fixes: traces no longer hide under plated holes, solder-mask traces shown bright green, board outline always ≥ 2 px ([pcb-viewer#646](https://github.com/tscircuit/pcb-viewer/pull/646), [pcb-viewer#648](https://github.com/tscircuit/pcb-viewer/pull/648), [pcb-viewer#652](https://github.com/tscircuit/pcb-viewer/pull/652))
- Autorouting & auto-layout disabled when inflating subcircuits from circuit-json to preserve designer intent ([core#1903](https://github.com/tscircuit/core/pull/1903))
- CLI gains new `tsci doctor` diagnostics plus safer build defaults & asset-path fixes ([cli#1893](https://github.com/tscircuit/cli/pull/1893), [cli#1879](https://github.com/tscircuit/cli/pull/1879), [cli#1916](https://github.com/tscircuit/cli/pull/1916))
- STEP exporter: pill & rotated-pill holes supported and invalid board-outline edges fixed ([circuit-json-to-step#50](https://github.com/tscircuit/circuit-json-to-step/pull/50), [circuit-json-to-step#48](https://github.com/tscircuit/circuit-json-to-step/pull/48))
- KiCad exporter improvements: 4-layer boards, courtyard shapes, path fill-color, potentiometer symbols, and duplicate-symbol fix ([circuit-json-to-kicad#110](https://github.com/tscircuit/circuit-json-to-kicad/pull/110), [circuit-json-to-kicad#119](https://github.com/tscircuit/circuit-json-to-kicad/pull/119), [circuit-json-to-kicad#124](https://github.com/tscircuit/circuit-json-to-kicad/pull/124), [circuit-json-to-kicad#128](https://github.com/tscircuit/circuit-json-to-kicad/pull/128), [circuit-json-to-kicad#126](https://github.com/tscircuit/circuit-json-to-kicad/pull/126))
- Graphics-debug & Hypergraph add first-class polygon support, per-polygon stroke width and consistent zoomed line-widths ([graphics-debug#95](https://github.com/tscircuit/graphics-debug/pull/95), [graphics-debug#97](https://github.com/tscircuit/graphics-debug/pull/97), [graphics-debug#93](https://github.com/tscircuit/graphics-debug/pull/93), [hypergraph#42](https://github.com/tscircuit/hypergraph/pull/42))
- Footprinter adds validated VSON footprint definition ([footprinter#500](https://github.com/tscircuit/footprinter/pull/500))
- DRC accuracy: false positive trace-overlap errors resolved ([core#1916](https://github.com/tscircuit/core/pull/1916))
