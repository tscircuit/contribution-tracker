# Changelog 2025-10

- SPICE arrives end-to-end – core integration (#1427, #1441), automatic .tran generation (#cjson-to-spice #13), switch support (#11) and new voltage-probe element/props (#306, props #432, core #1496).
- Autorouting leaps to multi-layer: core four-layer router (#1443) + autorouter package multi-layer engine & high-density caching (#tsc-autorouter #276, #279).
- Stronger PCB DRC: trace-out-of-board & disconnected-trace errors (#checks #79, #84), via-clearance error emission (#core #1459) and different-net via SVG snapshots (#checks #81).
- New PCB fabrication primitives – note/rect/line/path/dimension & courtyard support across schema, props and core (#cjson #311, props #446–#441, core #1483–#1499).
- Board UX upgrades: anchor position/alignment for PCB components (#core #1438) and board title/thickness & color props (#props #440, core #1477).
- KiCad export pipeline lands: CLI command (#cli #431) and full circuit-json-to-kicad converter (package #1-#18).
- 3D rendering overhaul: poppygl snapshot backend in CLI/STEP/3D viewer (#cli #435, poppygl #5-#9, circuit-json-to-step #4) plus environment-map & FR4 material tweaks (#3d-viewer #509, #511).
- SVG output improvements: multi-layer trace snapshots, solder-mask colour, staggered sim-graph dashes, dynamic pad scaling (#c-to-svg #364, #360, #363, #345, #353).
- Simulation timing & analog options: duration/timePerStep props (#props #437, cjson #304-#305) and new analog-simulation + voltage probes components (#props #428-#429, #439).
- Switch component revamp – schema, simulation handling & CLI support (#cjson #302, core #1446, cjson-to-spice #11).
- GLTF/GLB pipeline gains: bottom-side placement, board geometry via JSCAD, model URL fallbacks (#cjson-to-gltf #44, #40, #31, core #1434).
- Web app highlights: STEP download button (#tscircuit.com #1770), public org pages without login (#1774) and new user settings page (#1771).
- Packing/placement: boundary-aware solvers & outline support in calculate-packing (#55-#56) and core packing fixes for positioned parts (#1497).
- Utilities: math-utils polygon overlap helpers (#24-#23) and common CM5 connector components (#common #21).
- Misc: Autorouter prop autocomplete (#props #438), LED 3D colour support (#3d-viewer #520), voltage-controlled switch SPICEy support (#spicey #6).
