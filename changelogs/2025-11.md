# Changelog 2025-11

- Copper-pour overhaul: boardEdgeMargin, cutoutMargin & clearance props, via/trace cut-outs, optional solder-mask coverage, and automatic net creation (core [#1625](https://github.com/tscircuit/core/pull/1625), props [#488](https://github.com/tscircuit/props/pull/488) | [#490](https://github.com/tscircuit/props/pull/490), copper-pour-solver [#18](https://github.com/tscircuit/copper-pour-solver/pull/18), circuit-json-to-gerber [#62](https://github.com/tscircuit/circuit-json-to-gerber/pull/62), core [#1627](https://github.com/tscircuit/core/pull/1627))
- PCBBoard: width/height now optional and new shape field; viewers render boards without explicit size (circuit-json [#339](https://github.com/tscircuit/circuit-json/pull/339) | [#340](https://github.com/tscircuit/circuit-json/pull/340), pcb-viewer [#461](https://github.com/tscircuit/pcb-viewer/pull/461), core [#1622](https://github.com/tscircuit/core/pull/1622))
- pcb-viewer: rectangle components gain corner_radius for rounded boards/panels ([#460](https://github.com/tscircuit/pcb-viewer/pull/460))
- 3d-viewer: boards now load at the correct angle and with improved default camera; preset menu no longer forces “Custom” ([#551](https://github.com/tscircuit/3d-viewer/pull/551), [#552](https://github.com/tscircuit/3d-viewer/pull/552))
- CLI: `tsci build --transpile` for on-the-fly TS → JS builds and glob support in `tsci snapshot` (cli [#841](https://github.com/tscircuit/cli/pull/841), [#844](https://github.com/tscircuit/cli/pull/844))
- New PCB layout prop: minTraceWidth can now be set on groups (props [#489](https://github.com/tscircuit/props/pull/489))
- New footprints & 3D models: MELF, MicroMELF, MiniMELF and MS012 packages added (footprinter [#406](https://github.com/tscircuit/footprinter/pull/406); jscad-electronics [#195](https://github.com/tscircuit/jscad-electronics/pull/195) | [#196](https://github.com/tscircuit/jscad-electronics/pull/196) | [#197](https://github.com/tscircuit/jscad-electronics/pull/197) | [#199](https://github.com/tscircuit/jscad-electronics/pull/199))
- KiCad integration: support for new graphics primitives, polygon SMT pads and ViaGridBoard (kicadts [#18](https://github.com/tscircuit/kicadts/pull/18) | [#19](https://github.com/tscircuit/kicadts/pull/19) | [#21](https://github.com/tscircuit/kicadts/pull/21), circuit-json-to-kicad [#29](https://github.com/tscircuit/circuit-json-to-kicad/pull/29), kicad-to-circuit-json [#20](https://github.com/tscircuit/kicad-to-circuit-json/pull/20) | [#23](https://github.com/tscircuit/kicad-to-circuit-json/pull/23))
- Documentation: first scripting guide—learn how to programmatically compute circuit size (docs [#314](https://github.com/tscircuit/docs/pull/314))
- Runframe UI: natural filename sorting and console-like expandable error view (runframe [#1673](https://github.com/tscircuit/runframe/pull/1673), [#1672](https://github.com/tscircuit/runframe/pull/1672))
- Release-tracker integration added to schematic-viewer, pcb-viewer, 3d-viewer and runframe (schematic-viewer [#145](https://github.com/tscircuit/schematic-viewer/pull/145), pcb-viewer [#465](https://github.com/tscircuit/pcb-viewer/pull/465), 3d-viewer [#553](https://github.com/tscircuit/3d-viewer/pull/553), runframe [#1700](https://github.com/tscircuit/runframe/pull/1700))
