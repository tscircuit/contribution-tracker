- PCB panel “center” attribute with viewer/export support (circuit-json [#344](https://github.com/tscircuit/circuit-json/pull/344), pcb-viewer [#473](https://github.com/tscircuit/pcb-viewer/pull/473), core [#1650](https://github.com/tscircuit/core/pull/1650), circuit-to-svg [#421](https://github.com/tscircuit/circuit-to-svg/pull/421)).
- PCB board outlines: width/height now optional; new “shape” field (circuit-json [#339](https://github.com/tscircuit/circuit-json/pull/339), [#340](https://github.com/tscircuit/circuit-json/pull/340)); viewers cope with undefined dims (pcb-viewer [#461](https://github.com/tscircuit/pcb-viewer/pull/461), 3d-viewer [#554](https://github.com/tscircuit/3d-viewer/pull/554)).
- Geometry features: corner_radius on rectangle pads (pcb-viewer [#460](https://github.com/tscircuit/pcb-viewer/pull/460)); bottom-layer support for rectangular plated pads ([#468](https://github.com/tscircuit/pcb-viewer/pull/468)).
- Measurement UX: origin snapping for dimension tool ([#476](https://github.com/tscircuit/pcb-viewer/pull/476)), diagonal labels ([#477](https://github.com/tscircuit/pcb-viewer/pull/477)), correct text offset ([#470](https://github.com/tscircuit/pcb-viewer/pull/470)).
- 3D viewer upgrades: orthographic camera & new controller ([#569](https://github.com/tscircuit/3d-viewer/pull/569)), session-based camera persistence ([#557](https://github.com/tscircuit/3d-viewer/pull/557)), touch-screen context menu ([#562](https://github.com/tscircuit/3d-viewer/pull/562)), faux-board rendering ([#564](https://github.com/tscircuit/3d-viewer/pull/564)), silkscreen circle support ([#555](https://github.com/tscircuit/3d-viewer/pull/555)).
- Voltage probes revamped: nameable probes, better label alignment/arrow placement, and Spice node naming (circuit-json [#347](https://github.com/tscircuit/circuit-json/pull/347), [#348](https://github.com/tscircuit/circuit-json/pull/348); circuit-to-svg [#422](https://github.com/tscircuit/circuit-to-svg/pull/422), [#423](https://github.com/tscircuit/circuit-to-svg/pull/423); circuit-json-to-spice [#23](https://github.com/tscircuit/circuit-json-to-spice/pull/23)).
- Schematic viewer usability: control tooltips added (schematic-viewer [#146](https://github.com/tscircuit/schematic-viewer/pull/146)).
- Simulation & subcircuits: new unknown-experiment error type (core [#1632](https://github.com/tscircuit/core/pull/1632)); capacitors, inductors, diodes, and traces now supported inside subcircuits with improved net-name validation ([#1648](https://github.com/tscircuit/core/pull/1648)–[#1656](https://github.com/tscircuit/core/pull/1656)).
