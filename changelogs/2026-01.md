[#17](https://github.com/tscircuit/pcbburn.com/pull/17) [#18](https://github.com/tscircuit/pcbburn.com/pull/18) [#19](https://github.com/tscircuit/pcbburn.com/pull/19) [#20](https://github.com/tscircuit/pcbburn.com/pull/20) [#21](https://github.com/tscircuit/pcbburn.com/pull/21) [#22](https://github.com/tscircuit/pcbburn.com/pull/22) [#23](https://github.com/tscircuit/pcbburn.com/pull/23)
- tscircuit.com: new Builds & Releases pages, manual GitHub-sync button and refreshed release UI. [#2441](https://github.com/tscircuit/tscircuit.com/pull/2441) [#2446](https://github.com/tscircuit/tscircuit.com/pull/2446) [#2453](https://github.com/tscircuit/tscircuit.com/pull/2453)
- CLI: added buildCommand/prebuildCommand hooks, --include-dist & --ci flags, clearer push summaries, global registry setup and KiCad-library export support. [cli #1565](https://github.com/tscircuit/cli/pull/1565) [#1567](https://github.com/tscircuit/cli/pull/1567) [#1570](https://github.com/tscircuit/cli/pull/1570) [#1575](https://github.com/tscircuit/cli/pull/1575) [#1577](https://github.com/tscircuit/cli/pull/1577) [#1579](https://github.com/tscircuit/cli/pull/1579) [#1568](https://github.com/tscircuit/cli/pull/1568)
- Core PCB layout: panels wait for async footprints, group layouts handle async children, and jumper pad traces keep correct port IDs. [core #1819](https://github.com/tscircuit/core/pull/1819) [#1820](https://github.com/tscircuit/core/pull/1820) [#1826](https://github.com/tscircuit/core/pull/1826) [#1827](https://github.com/tscircuit/core/pull/1827)
- circuit-json-to-gltf: adds PCB-cutout support & fixes panel-texture bug. [#108](https://github.com/tscircuit/circuit-json-to-gltf/pull/108) [#109](https://github.com/tscircuit/circuit-json-to-gltf/pull/109)
