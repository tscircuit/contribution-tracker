  - PCB-viewer: hover highlighting for vias, plated holes and SMT pads plus layer-accurate copper-pour drawing ([pcb-viewer#590](https://github.com/tscircuit/pcb-viewer/pull/590), [#593](https://github.com/tscircuit/pcb-viewer/pull/593), [#595](https://github.com/tscircuit/pcb-viewer/pull/595), [#604](https://github.com/tscircuit/pcb-viewer/pull/604)).
  - Circuit-to-SVG keep-out areas now render with diagonal pattern & transparent background, with explicit viewport control ([circuit-to-svg#477](https://github.com/tscircuit/circuit-to-svg/pull/477), [#478](https://github.com/tscircuit/circuit-to-svg/pull/478)).
- 3-D viewer: automatic STEP→GLB fallback and unified hole-shape detection for accurate solder-mask textures ([3d-viewer#638](https://github.com/tscircuit/3d-viewer/pull/638), [#642](https://github.com/tscircuit/3d-viewer/pull/642)–[#647](https://github.com/tscircuit/3d-viewer/pull/647)).
- CLI quality-of-life
  - New flags: `--include-dist`, `--ci`, `prebuildCommand`, `buildCommand`, detailed push upload report ([cli#1565](https://github.com/tscircuit/cli/pull/1565), [#1568](https://github.com/tscircuit/cli/pull/1568), [#1570](https://github.com/tscircuit/cli/pull/1570), [#1575](https://github.com/tscircuit/cli/pull/1575), [#1577](https://github.com/tscircuit/cli/pull/1577)).
  - KiCad-library export now available via integrated KicadLibraryConverter API ([cli#1579](https://github.com/tscircuit/cli/pull/1579)).
- KiCad exporter: user/builtin library separation & default-export handling ([circuit-json-to-kicad#47](https://github.com/tscircuit/circuit-json-to-kicad/pull/47), [#49](https://github.com/tscircuit/circuit-json-to-kicad/pull/49)).
- pcbburn.com UX
  - Robust file-upload flow with loading state, inline errors & freeze fix ([pcbburn.com#17](https://github.com/tscircuit/pcbburn.com/pull/17), [#19](https://github.com/tscircuit/pcbburn.com/pull/19), [#20](https://github.com/tscircuit/pcbburn.com/pull/20)).
  - Live PCB-burn setting updates (no “draft” step) ([#21](https://github.com/tscircuit/pcbburn.com/pull/21)).
  - Auto-fit SVG preview, tab-style view selector & context-menu suppression ([#25](https://github.com/tscircuit/pcbburn.com/pull/25), [#16](https://github.com/tscircuit/pcbburn.com/pull/16), [#26](https://github.com/tscircuit/pcbburn.com/pull/26)).
