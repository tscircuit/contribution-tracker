# Changelog 2026-01

- Autorouter & Routing
  – tscircuit-autorouter: Introduced jumper routing (AssignablePipelineSolver3, jumper PF, six-lane 6×4 solver) and curvy-trace solver integration; added straight-line deviation penalty, keep-out fixes, high-density/jumper test suites, unused-jumper filtering, bug-report fixtures and new Pipeline 3 menu option.
  – core: Enabled jumper autorouting and connectivity, improved keep-out solver, exposed autorouterVersion/effort level, relaxed port-rip thresholds.
  – hypergraph + curvy-trace-solver: Gradient-descent & stochastic optimisation, jumper-aware bounds/serialization, cross-net intersection penalty, outside-bounds guard.

- Rendering & Visualization
  – circuit-to-canvas / circuit-to-svg: Added solder-mask margin (holes, polygons), copper-pour BREP support, diagonal keep-out hatching, explicit viewport control, knockout text refactor, border-radius helper.
  – pcb-viewer: Migrated keep-out, via, plated-hole and copper-pour rendering to circuit-to-canvas with full hover/highlight support; added SMT-pad hover.
  – 3d-viewer & circuit-json-to-gltf: STEP→GLB fallback, panel cut-out support, oval/pill hole handling and full pad-outline solder-mask clearance.

- CLI & Dev-Tooling
  – cli: New flags/commands –-include-dist, –-ci, buildCommand/prebuildCommand, push summary, KicadLibraryConverter export, binary-file clone handling, latest-tscircuit-on-cloud option; added global npmrc registry line and Bun loader for assets.
  – easyeda-converter: Fixed pin-label “#” suffix parsing and added parallel-test workflow.
  – math-utils: Added isPointInsideBounds & getBoundsCenter helpers.

- PCB/Footprint Libraries
  – footprinter: Convex/concave resistor arrays, 0402×2 variants, mounted-module snapshots; standardized naming (PcbSmtPad).
  – circuit-json: CCW rotation for pill holes, new rectangular-pad solder-mask fields.
  – sparkfun-boards & example-generated-kicad-library: Added new board/component sets and library export API.

- Web Apps & UI
  – pcbburn.com: Robust upload handling with loading/error states, live settings updates, SVG autofit, context-menu disable, numeric-control refactor, UI text tweaks.
  – tscircuit.com: Redesigned builds/releases pages, tab visibility logic, mobile repo view & manual GitHub sync, release-page UI polish.
  – status & contribution-tracker: Health-check fixes, maintainer and reimbursement entries.

- Miscellaneous Core Fixes
  – core: Async panel-layout wait, PCB note repositioning, schematicPath element support, solder-mask conflict warnings, panel layout for async footprints.
  – rectdiff: Resolved stalling on complex polygons.

These pull requests collectively deliver jumper-aware autorouting, richer rendering pipelines, enhanced CLI workflows, sturdier web-app UX, and expanded footprint/library support for the 2026-01 release.
