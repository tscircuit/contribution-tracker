# Changelog 2025-12

- Full copper-text pipeline: knockout/mirrored copper text now renders in the PCB viewer, 3-D viewer, SVG, Canvas and Gerber outputs ([pcb-viewer #525](https://github.com/tscircuit/pcb-viewer/pull/525), [3d-viewer #617](https://github.com/tscircuit/3d-viewer/pull/617), [circuit-to-svg #442](https://github.com/tscircuit/circuit-to-svg/pull/442), [circuit-to-canvas #6](https://github.com/tscircuit/circuit-to-canvas/pull/6), [circuit-json-to-gerber #74](https://github.com/tscircuit/circuit-json-to-gerber/pull/74)).
- New anchor-offset & relative-positioning system: groups/boards can anchor to each other with live overlay and SVG debug support ([pcb-viewer #539](https://github.com/tscircuit/pcb-viewer/pull/539), [pcb-viewer #542](https://github.com/tscircuit/pcb-viewer/pull/542), [pcb-viewer #537](https://github.com/tscircuit/pcb-viewer/pull/537), [core #1757](https://github.com/tscircuit/core/pull/1757), [circuit-to-svg #449](https://github.com/tscircuit/circuit-to-svg/pull/449)).
- Panel & panelization upgrades: fiducials, sub-panels, boardGap, edge-margin props and tab-routing for custom outlines; default panelization set to "none" ([props #526](https://github.com/tscircuit/props/pull/526), [core #1728](https://github.com/tscircuit/core/pull/1728), [core #1729](https://github.com/tscircuit/core/pull/1729), [core #1722](https://github.com/tscircuit/core/pull/1722), [core #1740](https://github.com/tscircuit/core/pull/1740)).
- 3-D viewer improvements: texture-layer rendering, selectable solder-mask, board-outline display in panels, fabrication-note rectangles and z-fighting fixes ([3d-viewer #614](https://github.com/tscircuit/3d-viewer/pull/614), [3d-viewer #595](https://github.com/tscircuit/3d-viewer/pull/595), [3d-viewer #619](https://github.com/tscircuit/3d-viewer/pull/619), [3d-viewer #597](https://github.com/tscircuit/3d-viewer/pull/597), [3d-viewer #611](https://github.com/tscircuit/3d-viewer/pull/611)).
- PCB viewer UX fixes: pill-pad rotation, correct panel centering, alphabet-baseline text, cross-style group markers and context-menu suppression ([pcb-viewer #523](https://github.com/tscircuit/pcb-viewer/pull/523), [pcb-viewer #520](https://github.com/tscircuit/pcb-viewer/pull/520), [pcb-viewer #515](https://github.com/tscircuit/pcb-viewer/pull/515), [pcb-viewer #541](https://github.com/tscircuit/pcb-viewer/pull/541), [pcb-viewer #518](https://github.com/tscircuit/pcb-viewer/pull/518)).
- Voltage-probe labels: automatic nine-point alignment plus SVG bounds fixes to prevent text overflow ([core #1756](https://github.com/tscircuit/core/pull/1756), [circuit-to-svg #455](https://github.com/tscircuit/circuit-to-svg/pull/455)).
