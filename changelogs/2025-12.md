# Changelog 2025-12

- Copper text end-to-end: normal & knockout copper text now render in the PCB viewer, SVG, 3 D, canvas and Gerber outputs ([pcb-viewer#525](https://github.com/tscircuit/pcb-viewer/pull/525), [circuit-to-svg#442](https://github.com/tscircuit/circuit-to-svg/pull/442), [3d-viewer#617](https://github.com/tscircuit/3d-viewer/pull/617), [circuit-json-to-gerber#74](https://github.com/tscircuit/circuit-json-to-gerber/pull/74), [circuit-to-canvas#6](https://github.com/tscircuit/circuit-to-canvas/pull/6))
- 3 D viewer overhaul for solder-mask & textures: added texture layer support and fixed z-fighting, cut-outs, plated-hole, color and transparency issues ([3d-viewer#614](https://github.com/tscircuit/3d-viewer/pull/614), [#611](https://github.com/tscircuit/3d-viewer/pull/611), [#601](https://github.com/tscircuit/3d-viewer/pull/601), [#602](https://github.com/tscircuit/3d-viewer/pull/602), [#603](https://github.com/tscircuit/3d-viewer/pull/603), [#604](https://github.com/tscircuit/3d-viewer/pull/604), [#606](https://github.com/tscircuit/3d-viewer/pull/606), [#605](https://github.com/tscircuit/3d-viewer/pull/605), [#600](https://github.com/tscircuit/3d-viewer/pull/600), [#599](https://github.com/tscircuit/3d-viewer/pull/599))
- Anchor offsets & relative positioning: new boardGap / anchorAlignment props and visual overlays let boards & groups be positioned relative to each other with edge-padding controls ([props#526](https://github.com/tscircuit/props/pull/526), [pcb-viewer#539](https://github.com/tscircuit/pcb-viewer/pull/539), [core#1757](https://github.com/tscircuit/core/pull/1757), [circuit-to-svg#447](https://github.com/tscircuit/circuit-to-svg/pull/447))
- Panelization rewrite: new tab-routing for custom outlines, rebuilt mouse-bite logic, configurable edge padding and ‘none’ as the default panelization method ([core#1729](https://github.com/tscircuit/core/pull/1729), [#1728](https://github.com/tscircuit/core/pull/1728), [#1740](https://github.com/tscircuit/core/pull/1740), [#1722](https://github.com/tscircuit/core/pull/1722))
- Pad improvements: pill-shaped SMT pads rotate correctly and polygon pads are fully supported in packing & transforms ([pcb-viewer#523](https://github.com/tscircuit/pcb-viewer/pull/523), [circuit-json-util#71](https://github.com/tscircuit/circuit-json-util/pull/71), [core#1714](https://github.com/tscircuit/core/pull/1714))
- Better vias: cleaner via geometry in 3 D viewer and packing engine now treats vias as pads for obstruction checks ([3d-viewer#594](https://github.com/tscircuit/3d-viewer/pull/594), [#618](https://github.com/tscircuit/3d-viewer/pull/618), [calculate-packing#84](https://github.com/tscircuit/calculate-packing/pull/84))
- SPICE enhancements: accurate default MOSFET models and working buck-converter simulations ([core#1727](https://github.com/tscircuit/core/pull/1727), [circuit-json-to-spice#30](https://github.com/tscircuit/circuit-json-to-spice/pull/30))
- CLI QoL: export to KiCad footprint library and package-name validation for `tsci push` ([cli#1254](https://github.com/tscircuit/cli/pull/1254), [cli#1309](https://github.com/tscircuit/cli/pull/1309))
