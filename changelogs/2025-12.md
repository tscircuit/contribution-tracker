# Changelog 2025-12

- Copper text everywhere – normal & knockout copper text now renders in PCB viewer, 3 D viewer, SVG and Gerber output ([pcb-viewer #525](https://github.com/tscircuit/pcb-viewer/pull/525), [3d-viewer #617](https://github.com/tscircuit/3d-viewer/pull/617), [circuit-to-svg #442](https://github.com/tscircuit/circuit-to-svg/pull/442), [circuit-json-to-gerber #74](https://github.com/tscircuit/circuit-json-to-gerber/pull/74))
- Panel & board layout overhaul – new <fiducial/> & <subpanel/>, grid/board-gap layout modes, anchor alignment, edge padding, and board-relative component positioning ([props #526](https://github.com/tscircuit/props/pull/526), [props #528](https://github.com/tscircuit/props/pull/528), [props #529](https://github.com/tscircuit/props/pull/529), [circuit-json #370](https://github.com/tscircuit/circuit-json/pull/370), [core #1736](https://github.com/tscircuit/core/pull/1736), [core #1740](https://github.com/tscircuit/core/pull/1740))
- Panelization & tab-routing rewrite – smarter tab / mouse-bite generation and support for custom board outlines; default panelization is now “none” ([core #1729](https://github.com/tscircuit/core/pull/1729), [core #1728](https://github.com/tscircuit/core/pull/1728), [core #1722](https://github.com/tscircuit/core/pull/1722))
- PCB viewer quality-of-life – correct pill-pad rotation, baseline-aligned text, fixed panel centering & anchor positions, and right-click disabled ([pcb-viewer #523](https://github.com/tscircuit/pcb-viewer/pull/523), [pcb-viewer #515](https://github.com/tscircuit/pcb-viewer/pull/515), [pcb-viewer #520](https://github.com/tscircuit/pcb-viewer/pull/520), [pcb-viewer #535](https://github.com/tscircuit/pcb-viewer/pull/535), [pcb-viewer #518](https://github.com/tscircuit/pcb-viewer/pull/518))
- 3 D viewer upgrades – texture-layer rendering, full solder-mask coverage with cut-out & hole fixes, board-outline-in-panel visualisation ([3d-viewer #614](https://github.com/tscircuit/3d-viewer/pull/614), [3d-viewer #595](https://github.com/tscircuit/3d-viewer/pull/595), [3d-viewer #619](https://github.com/tscircuit/3d-viewer/pull/619))
- Autorouter gains smarter nets – net-merging, iterative trace simplification and outline-aware obstacle clipping ([tscircuit-autorouter #364](https://github.com/tscircuit/tscircuit-autorouter/pull/364), [tscircuit-autorouter #366](https://github.com/tscircuit/tscircuit-autorouter/pull/366), [tscircuit-autorouter #371](https://github.com/tscircuit/tscircuit-autorouter/pull/371), [tscircuit-autorouter #387](https://github.com/tscircuit/tscircuit-autorouter/pull/387))
- CLI: KiCad footprint-library export plus multiple upload & preview fixes ([cli #1254](https://github.com/tscircuit/cli/pull/1254), [cli #1240](https://github.com/tscircuit/cli/pull/1240), [cli #1270](https://github.com/tscircuit/cli/pull/1270), [cli #1246](https://github.com/tscircuit/cli/pull/1246), [cli #1296](https://github.com/tscircuit/cli/pull/1296))
- SPICE improvements – correct inductance handling and more realistic default MOSFET models, enabling buck-converter simulations ([core #1727](https://github.com/tscircuit/core/pull/1727), [circuit-json-to-spice #28](https://github.com/tscircuit/circuit-json-to-spice/pull/28), [#29](https://github.com/tscircuit/circuit-json-to-spice/pull/29), [#30](https://github.com/tscircuit/circuit-json-to-spice/pull/30))
- Packing & placement – treat relative components as static, board-via pads supported during packing, weighted-connection heuristics ([core #1730](https://github.com/tscircuit/core/pull/1730), [calculate-packing #84](https://github.com/tscircuit/calculate-packing/pull/84), [calculate-packing #81](https://github.com/tscircuit/calculate-packing/pull/81))
