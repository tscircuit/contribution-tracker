# Changelog 2025-12

Key highlights for 2025-12
- Copper text everywhere – pcb-viewer (#525), SVG (#442 #444), Gerber (#74) and 3-D viewer (#617) now render pcb_copper_text with optional knockout.
- 3-D viewer overhaul – texture-layer rendering (#614), full solder-mask support & fixes (#595-606 #611), plated-hole rendering fixes (#608) and transparency improvements (#589); manifold-trace bug squashed (#618).
- SMT pads – pill-pad rotation bug fixed in pcb-viewer (#523) and polygon SMT pads fully handled in circuit-json-util (#71).
- Panelization & packing – grid-packing refactor (#1736), new tab / mouse-bite logic (#1729), custom-outline tab-routing (#1728); lifecycle events & better error reporting (#1734); components marked “relative” treated as static during packing (#1730).  Packing libs add via-as-pad and weighted-connection support (calculate-packing #84 #81).
- Autorouter leaps – iterative trace-simplification solver (#366), physical net-merge logic (#364), board-outline awareness (#371), high-density solver tweaks & LGA example (#387 #390).
- SPICE tool-chain – inductance fix & buck-converter support in core (#1727); proper MOSFET models in circuit-json-to-spice (#28-30).
- CLI – tsci export now ships KiCad footprint-library output (#1254); UX fixes for project naming, preview-image and local-file GLTF (#1289 #1270 #1257).
- Viewer polish – text baseline alignment (#515), panel-center calc fix (#520) and right-click disabled (#518).
- Geometry / GLTF – translucent-model support added (#96) and OBJ positioning corrected (#95).
- Misc. fixes – circle plated-hole solder-mask flag (circuit-json #367); via route_type duplication removed (dsn-converter #117); countless rotation, cut-out, z-fighting and color bugs closed across converters and viewers.
